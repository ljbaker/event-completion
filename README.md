# event-completion
Repository of stimuli for the event completion experiments of Kominsky, Baker, Keil &amp; Strickland



# Summary

This repo contains the stimuli used in several experiments on the perception of
causal events. Participants watched these videos and responded whether they saw
a series of still images in each video. The critical measure was increased false
memories for still images that complete a causal pattern of events, even when
not actually seen.

# Stimuli

Stimuli are organized by condition

## Event Type
*Causal* - an event that conforms to an easily understood causal schema (e.g., launchng a ball and seeing it fly through a hoop).

*Non Sequitor* - an event that does not conform to an easily understood causal schema, with a conclusion that has no logical bearing on the antecedant action (e.g., launchng a ball and seeing an inanimate background object suddenly move).

*Reversed* - identical to the causal event, except that the final concluding action is seen in reverse (e.g., launching a ball and seeing it fly backwards through a hoop towards the launch area).

## Event Completion

*Complete* - The antecedent action is completed (e.g., the ball is seen being launched).

*Incomplete* - The antecedent action is not completed (e.g., the ball is not seen being launched).

## Causal Visibility

*Visible* - The object is visibly throughough the video (e.g. the ball is seen being launched and interacting with the hoop).

*Invisible* - The object is visible in the setup of the action, but invisible in the conclusion of the video (e.g., the ball is seen being launched but is invisible interacting with the hoop, and the hoop appears to move on its own).

# Experiment Order

## Experiment 1
Used live-action videos (not currently available)

## Experiment 2
Used animated stimuli from the Causal-Complete-Visible, Casual-Incomplete-Invisible and Causal-Non-Sequitor-Visible conditions

## Experiment 3

## Experiment 4
